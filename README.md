## Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😁
I'm an aspiring developer transitioning from electronics to software, having recently graduated with a master's degree in computer engineering from Arizona State University. Currently employed at EPICS @ ASU, I volunteer to contribute to projects addressing community and industry-based problems. Excited to learn, build, and contribute towards innovative software solutions.
